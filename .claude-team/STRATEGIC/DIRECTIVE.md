# Strategic Directive

> **Status:** ⏳ AWAITING DIRECTIVE
> **From:** Strategic Partner
> **To:** Lead Agent

---

## No Active Directive

The Strategic Partner has not yet issued a directive for this sprint.

### How This Works

1. **Andy** tells the Strategic Partner what feature to build
2. **Strategic Partner** (Desktop App) plans the architecture and writes this directive
3. **Lead Agent** reads this file and creates task files for workers
4. **Workers** execute their tasks in parallel
5. **Lead Agent** integrates and reports back
6. **Strategic Partner** reviews, updates changelog, and commits

---

## Waiting for Instructions

When the Strategic Partner is ready, this file will be replaced with a complete directive containing:

- Feature overview
- Requirements
- Architecture decisions
- Task assignments
- Acceptance criteria
- Files to create/modify

---

*Check back after Strategic Partner issues a new directive.*
