# Sprint v2.0.34 Retrospective

**Sprint:** v2.0.34 "Bug Fix + Enterprise Providers"
**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Duration:** 1 day (quick sprint)

---

## What Went Well

1. **Parallel Agent Execution** - Launched 6 agents simultaneously (1 Dev + 5 Architects) with all completing successfully
2. **Integration Studies Efficient** - 4 of 5 providers already work with no code changes needed
3. **Google Photos Fix Quick** - Dev-1 identified and fixed OAuth scope issue rapidly
4. **Build System Robust** - Pre-commit hooks caught a missing switch case immediately
5. **Documentation Complete** - All 5 architect reports are comprehensive with code samples

---

## What Could Be Improved

1. **update-version.sh Bug** - Script has sed regex issue on macOS, required manual version updates
2. **CI Build Rate Low** - 45% pass rate affecting health score (historical issue)
3. **Velocity Negative** - Creating 30+ integration study tickets inflated "opened" count

## Action Items

| Item | Owner | Priority |
|------|-------|----------|
| Fix update-version.sh sed regex | DevOps | Medium |
| Investigate CI failures | DevOps | Low |
| Create MEGA 2FA support (#160) | Dev | Medium |

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Version | 2.0.33 | 2.0.34 |
| Tests | 855 | 855 |
| Health Score | 75% | 80% |
| Open Issues | 36 | 30 |

## Sprint Summary

This was a research-focused sprint that validated CloudSync Ultra's enterprise provider support. The key finding - 4 of 5 studied providers already work - demonstrates strong rclone integration. Only MEGA needs a 2FA field addition.

The Google Photos OAuth fix resolved a scope permission issue by adding `read_only=true`.

**Velocity:** 6 tasks completed in 1 day using parallel agent execution.
