# Sprint v2.0.37 Retrospective

**Sprint:** v2.0.37 "Bug Fixes & S3-Compatible Providers"
**Date:** 2026-01-18
**Duration:** ~2 hours

---

## What Went Well

1. **Two-Phase Sprint Successful** - First sprint with dedicated QA phase worked smoothly
2. **Bug Fix Quality** - Both dev tasks (#165, #164) verified by QA before closure
3. **Parallel Execution** - 6 agents in Phase 1 + QA in Phase 2 = efficient workflow
4. **S3-Compatible Coverage** - All 4 studied providers already fully implemented
5. **Security Improvement** - FTPS toggle with plain FTP warning adds real value
6. **Health Score Improved** - 75% → 80%

---

## What Could Be Improved

1. **ownCloud Bug Found Late** - Should have been caught in v2.0.36 study
2. **QA Timing** - Could run QA in parallel with architects for faster sprints
3. **Nextcloud Also Missing** - Both cases were missing, not just ownCloud

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Integration Studies Reveal Bugs** - v2.0.36 ownCloud study found the missing case
2. **QA Verification Valuable** - Caught potential issues before release
3. **S3-Compatible = Already Works** - DigitalOcean, Wasabi, Scaleway, Filebase all work
4. **Security UX Matters** - Plain FTP warning helps users make informed choices
