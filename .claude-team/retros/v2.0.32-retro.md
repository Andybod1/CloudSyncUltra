# Sprint Retrospective: v2.0.32

**Date:** 2026-01-16
**Sprint:** Interactive Onboarding + Windows Research

---

## What Went Well ✅

1. **Parallel worker execution** - Dev-1 and Architect ran simultaneously, completing in ~20 minutes total
2. **Wizard reuse** - Interactive onboarding leveraged existing ProviderConnectionWizard and TransferWizard with minimal new code
3. **Clean integration** - OnboardingViewModel changes were minimal (added 2 properties + 1 method)
4. **Comprehensive research** - Architect produced thorough Windows port analysis with clear recommendation

---

## What Didn't Go Well ⚠️

1. **Minor**: SourceKit showed transient errors during Dev-1's editing (normal but noisy)
2. **Minor**: Had to manually check if workers completed vs automatic notification

---

## What to Improve 💡

1. **Consider**: Add a "worker status" command to quickly check all running agents
2. **Consider**: Template for research tasks to ensure consistent deliverables
3. **Document**: Worker agent parallel execution pattern works well - use more often

---

## Key Learnings 📚

- Building wizard infrastructure first (v2.0.31) made this sprint trivial
- Research tasks work well with Architect agent
- Backlog is now empty - good milestone achieved
