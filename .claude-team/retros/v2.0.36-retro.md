# Sprint v2.0.36 Retrospective

**Sprint:** v2.0.36 "Cloud Platforms & File Protocols"
**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Duration:** ~2 hours (quick sprint)

---

## What Went Well

1. **Parallel Execution Perfect** - 6 agents completed simultaneously with no conflicts
2. **SFTP SSH Key Implementation Clean** - Dev-1 followed existing patterns (similar to ProtonDrive 2FA)
3. **Build Verification Automatic** - Pre-commit hooks caught version mismatch before commit
4. **Excellent Provider Coverage** - All 5 studied providers work out of the box
5. **Comprehensive Studies** - Each architect produced detailed 10-20KB reports

---

## What Could Be Improved

1. **update-version.sh sed Issue** - macOS sed regex compatibility bug persists
2. **Version Check Scope** - Pre-commit caught project.pbxproj version mismatch late
3. **Flaky Async Tests** - 28 timing-dependent test failures (0 unexpected)

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Object Storage Universally Compatible** - Azure, GCS, Storj all work immediately
2. **WebDAV Protocol Versatile** - ownCloud works via WebDAV (same as Nextcloud)
3. **FTP Well Supported** - Both FTP and FTPS work with existing rclone integration
4. **SSH Key UX Pattern** - NSOpenPanel with hidden files for ~/.ssh/ works well

## Action Items

| Item | Owner | Priority |
|------|-------|----------|
| Fix update-version.sh sed regex | DevOps | Low |
| Add project.pbxproj to version-check early | DevOps | Low |
| Consider mocking async timing tests | QA | Low |

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Version | 2.0.35 | 2.0.36 |
| Tests | 855 | 855 |
| Health Score | 75% | 80% |
| Open Issues | 26 | 20 |

## Sprint Summary

Third sprint of the day (v2.0.34, v2.0.35, v2.0.36), demonstrating consistent parallel agent execution. Combined output across all three:
- 3 implementations (Google Photos OAuth, MEGA 2FA, SFTP SSH Keys)
- 16 integration studies completed
- 14 of 16 providers already work with no code changes
- 6 issues closed this sprint

**Total Day Velocity:** 18 tasks using parallel agents.
