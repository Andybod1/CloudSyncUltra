# Sprint v2.0.35 Retrospective

**Sprint:** v2.0.35 "Cloud Storage & Protocols"
**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Duration:** ~2 hours (quick sprint)

---

## What Went Well

1. **Parallel Execution Efficient** - 6 agents completed in parallel with no conflicts
2. **MEGA 2FA Implementation Clean** - Dev-1 followed existing ProtonDrive pattern perfectly
3. **Build Verification Automatic** - Pre-commit hooks caught and verified all changes
4. **Strong Provider Coverage** - 5 of 6 studied providers already work out of the box
5. **Comprehensive Studies** - Each architect produced detailed 10-25KB reports

---

## What Could Be Improved

1. **CHANGELOG Version Mismatch** - Had to manually fix v2.0.34 content appearing under v2.0.35
2. **Test Infrastructure Issue** - UI test Info.plist permission error (unrelated to code changes)
3. **update-version.sh Still Broken** - sed regex issue persists from v2.0.34

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Object Storage Well Supported** - S3, B2, R2 all use optimized parallelism (16/32)
2. **SFTP Needs Enhancement** - Only provider needing significant UI work (SSH keys)
3. **WebDAV Vendor Detection** - Could improve UX with automatic vendor detection

## Action Items

| Item | Owner | Priority |
|------|-------|----------|
| Fix update-version.sh | DevOps | Low |
| Implement SFTP SSH Key UI (#163) | Dev | Medium |
| Clean up stale CI failures | DevOps | Low |

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Version | 2.0.34 | 2.0.35 |
| Tests | 855 | 855 |
| Health Score | 75% | 80% |
| Open Issues | 30 | 26 |

## Sprint Summary

Two sprints completed in a single day (v2.0.34 + v2.0.35), demonstrating efficient parallel agent execution. Combined output:
- 2 implementations (Google Photos OAuth, MEGA 2FA)
- 11 integration studies completed
- 9 of 11 providers already work with no code changes

**Total Velocity:** 12 tasks in 1 day using parallel agents.
