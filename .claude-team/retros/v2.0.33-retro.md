# Sprint v2.0.33 Retrospective

**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Sprint Name:** Schedule Wizard Polish

---

## What Went Well

1. **Quick Bug Fixes** - Multiple user-reported issues fixed in a single session
   - "No data" display issue identified and fixed with fallback progress
   - TransferError messages made human-readable via LocalizedError
   - Encryption toggle setup integrated seamlessly

2. **macOS Permissions Handled Correctly** - Used native NSOpenPanel for local folder selection instead of trying to work around sandbox permissions

3. **Automated Release Process** - release.sh script executed all 6 steps automatically, streamlining the sprint close

---

## What Didn't Go Well

1. **Version Mismatch After Release** - release.sh didn't update all docs, had to manually fix:
   - CLAUDE_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md
   - STATUS.md
   - RECOVERY.md
   - PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
   - CHANGELOG.md

2. **Duplicate File Confusion** - RemoteFolderBrowser.swift existed in two locations, causing build errors until the duplicate was removed

---

## What to Improve

1. **Update release.sh** - Ensure update-version.sh catches all version references across all docs

2. **File Cleanup** - Before adding new files, search for existing duplicates in the codebase

3. **Pre-commit Hook** - Consider adding version-check.sh to pre-commit hooks to catch mismatches earlier
