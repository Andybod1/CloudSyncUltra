# Marketing Launch Checklist: CloudSync Ultra

**Issue:** #86
**Date:** January 14, 2026
**Worker:** Marketing Strategist (Research)
**Product:** CloudSync Ultra - macOS Cloud Storage Management App
**Distribution Phase:** Phase 1 - Direct Download from Website

---

## Overview

This checklist provides a comprehensive, actionable timeline for CloudSync Ultra's Phase 1 launch. Tasks are organized into four phases: Pre-Launch (Weeks -8 to -1), Launch Day, Post-Launch (Week 1-2), and Sustained Growth (Months 1-3).

**Critical Note:** Product Hunt's algorithm changed significantly in January 2024. Only 10% of products now get Featured, and Featured status determines 70% of success. This checklist accounts for these changes with extended preparation time.

### MacStories Pitch

Subject: CloudSync Ultra - Native macOS Cloud Storage Manager

Hi,

I'm reaching out about CloudSync Ultra, a new macOS app for managing
multiple cloud storage services that I think would interest MacStories readers.

What makes it different:
- Native SwiftUI app (no Electron)
- 42+ cloud services in one interface
- Per-remote encryption with zero-knowledge option
- Scheduled automatic sync
- Menu bar quick access

I've been inspired by apps like Transmit and CloudMounter but wanted to
create something more focused on multi-cloud workflows with better
encryption options.

### r/macapps Post

Title: [Show off Saturday] I built CloudSync Ultra - a cloud storage manager for Mac

Hey r/macapps!

I'm the developer of CloudSync Ultra, a new macOS app I've been working on
for the past [X months].

**The problem I was solving:** I use Google Drive for work, Dropbox for
personal stuff, and S3 for backups. Managing them all was a mess.

**What it does:**
- Connects to 42+ cloud services (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, S3, etc.)
- Dual-pane file browser for easy transfers
- Per-remote encryption (your keys, not mine)
- Scheduled sync

**Tech stack:** Swift/SwiftUI, uses rclone under the hood

I'd love any feedback - brutal honesty welcome! What features would make
this more useful for you?

[Link to website]

(I'm the developer - happy to answer any questions!)
```

### r/cloudstorage Post

```
Title: After trying 6 different cloud storage management solutions, I built my own

I've been using multiple cloud services for years (Google Drive for work,
Dropbox personal, S3 for backups) and could never find a good way to
manage them all on Mac.

Tried CloudMounter, ExpanDrive, even Cyberduck - all good apps, but each
had something that didn't quite fit my workflow.

So I built CloudSync Ultra. It's a native Mac app that:
- Connects to 42+ cloud services
- Does drag-and-drop transfers between any services
- Offers per-remote encryption (important for my work files)
- Runs scheduled syncs in the background

Not trying to sell anything - genuinely curious what features matter most
to people here. What pain points do you have with managing multiple cloud
services?

Full disclosure: I'm the developer.
