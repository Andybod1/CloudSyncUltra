- Enterprise tier - compliance, SSO, pricing model

**Answer:**
- What's the optimal price point for each tier?

- Annual discount strategy?
- Trial length and conversion tactics?

### 3. Customer Segmentation
Define target segments:

- Freelancers/Creators
- Small teams

For each: pain points, willingness to pay, acquisition channels

### 4. Go-to-Market Strategy

- Community building

**Growth levers:**

### 5. Revenue Model
Project revenue scenarios:

- Moderate: Year 1-3 projections  
- Aggressive: Year 1-3 projections

With assumptions for: conversion rates, churn, expansion revenue

### 6. Monetization Roadmap
Phase the revenue features:
- Phase 1 (Launch): What's MVP for monetization?
