# Task: Menu Bar Schedule Indicator - Core Engine

**Assigned to:** Dev-2 (Core Engine)
**Priority:** Low
**Status:** Ready
**Depends on:** None

---

## Objective

**NO CHANGES REQUIRED** for this feature.

The Menu Bar Schedule Indicator feature only requires UI changes to display existing ScheduleManager data. RcloneManager and other core engine components do not need modifications.

---

## Task Summary

This is a placeholder task acknowledging that the Core Engine (Dev-2) has no work for this sprint.

The ScheduleManager already provides all necessary data:
- `nextScheduledRun` property returns the next scheduled sync
- `formattedNextRun` provides human-readable time formatting
- All APIs are already in place from the previous sprint

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Acknowledge no changes needed
- [x] Verify existing ScheduleManager APIs are sufficient

---

## When Complete

1. Update STATUS.md with: "No changes required for this feature"
2. Write DEV2_COMPLETE.md acknowledging placeholder status
