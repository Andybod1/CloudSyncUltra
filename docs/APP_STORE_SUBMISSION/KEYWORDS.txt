## Keyword Strategy Rationale

### Brand Keywords (27 chars)
- **dropbox, gdrive, onedrive, s3, mega** - Users often search for specific cloud services they want to sync

### Core Function Keywords (29 chars)
- **sync, backup, cloud, transfer, storage, file** - Generic terms that describe what the app does

### Technical Keywords (13 chars)
- **ftp, sftp, webdav** - Users looking for specific protocol support

### Feature Keywords (10 chars)
- **encryption** - Security-conscious users

## Alternative Keywords Considered

These keywords were considered but excluded due to character limit:

- proton, box, pcloud (other providers)
- mac, macos (platform - less critical as App Store already filters by platform)
- manager, browser, client (generic app types)
- multi-cloud, multicloud (too long, covered by other terms)
- nextcloud, owncloud (self-hosted options)
- aws, azure (enterprise clouds - s3 covers AWS)

## Optimization Notes

1. **No spaces after commas** - Saves character count
2. **Abbreviated where possible** - "gdrive" instead of "google drive"
3. **Prioritized high-search volume** - Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive are most searched
4. **Included differentiators** - FTP/SFTP/WebDAV support sets us apart
5. **Security angle** - "encryption" targets privacy-conscious users

## A/B Testing Recommendations

Consider testing these alternative keyword sets in future updates:

**Set B - Provider Focus (100 chars):**
dropbox,google drive,onedrive,box,mega,s3,proton,icloud,sync,backup,transfer,cloud,file,encryption

**Set C - Technical Focus (98 chars):**
