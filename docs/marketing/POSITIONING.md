## Objection Handling

### "Why should I pay for sync when providers offer it free?"
**Response:** Provider sync apps work in silos. CloudSync Ultra connects all your clouds, enabling workflows impossible with individual apps—like syncing Dropbox to S3, or backing up Google Drive to Backblaze.

### "How do I know my data is secure?"
**Response:** Your data never touches our servers. All processing happens locally on your Mac, credentials are stored in macOS Keychain, and you can enable end-to-end encryption for any remote.

### "$10/month seems expensive for sync"
**Response:** Consider the hours saved weekly. If CloudSync Ultra saves you just 30 minutes per month, it pays for itself. Most users save 2-3 hours weekly on file management tasks.

### "What if you go out of business?"
**Response:** The app works locally on your machine. Even if we disappeared tomorrow, your existing copy would continue working. We're also exploring open-source options for core functionality.
