### Section Header
**Questions? We've got answers.**

### Q1: What cloud providers do you support?
**A:** We support 42+ providers including Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud, Box, AWS S3, Backblaze B2, Wasabi, MEGA, pCloud, Proton Drive, and many more. [See the full list →]

### Q2: Is my data secure?
**A:** Absolutely. CloudSync Ultra never stores your files or credentials on our servers. All processing happens locally on your Mac. Your credentials are encrypted and stored in macOS Keychain. You can also enable end-to-end encryption for any remote.

### Q3: What happens to my files?
**A:** Your files stay exactly where they are—in your cloud accounts. CloudSync Ultra simply helps you sync between them. We never store, view, or have access to your files.

### Q4: Can I try before buying?
**A:** Yes! Start with our free tier (2 connections, manual sync) or try Pro features free for 30 days. No credit card required to start.

### Q5: What's the difference between sync and backup?
**A:** Sync keeps folders identical between two locations. Backup creates a one-way copy for safekeeping. CloudSync Ultra supports both modes.

### Q6: Do you have a Windows version?
**A:** We're currently macOS only, focusing on delivering the best possible Mac experience. Windows and Linux versions are on our roadmap.

### Q7: Can I sync between the same provider?
**A:** Yes! You can sync between different accounts on the same provider (e.g., personal Dropbox to work Dropbox) or between different folders in the same account.

### Q8: What about large files?
**A:** CloudSync Ultra is optimized for large files with chunk-based transfers, automatic resume, and bandwidth throttling. We regularly test with files up to 100GB.

### Q9: How do I cancel?
**A:** Cancel anytime from the app or your account page. No phone calls, no retention team. If you cancel, you'll have access until the end of your billing period.

### Q10: What if I need help?
**A:** Free users get community support. Pro users get priority support with <4 hour response time. Team users get dedicated onboarding and SLA guarantees.
