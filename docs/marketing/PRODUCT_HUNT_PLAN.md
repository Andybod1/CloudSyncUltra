## Launch Day Strategy

### First Comment (Pinned)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

After juggling 10+ cloud accounts across different providers, I built CloudSync Ultra to solve my own problem. Now it supports 42+ providers!

🔥 **What makes it special:**
• More providers than all competitors combined (42+ vs their 10-20)
• Complete privacy - no cloud backend, everything processes locally
• Native macOS app (SwiftUI, not Electron)
• 90% cheaper than alternatives ($9.99/mo vs $99/mo)

💡 **Use cases our beta testers love:**
• Backing up Google Photos to Backblaze B2
• Syncing client Dropbox files to company S3
• Mirroring OneDrive to local NAS via SFTP
• Consolidating multiple personal clouds

🎁 **Product Hunt exclusive:**
50% off first year for everyone who signs up today with code PHUNT50

I'm here all day to answer questions. What cloud juggling nightmares can CloudSync Ultra solve for you?

PS: We have a free tier with 2 connections if you want to test it out!

1/ Launched CloudSync Ultra on @ProductHunt! 🚀

One app that syncs 42+ cloud providers with complete privacy.

[Product Hunt Link]

Here's why I built it... 🧵

2/ Problem: I had files scattered across 10+ clouds
• Work stuff in Google Drive
• Personal in Dropbox
• Backups in B2
• Code in GitHub

Managing it was a nightmare.

3/ Existing solutions sucked:
• Most support only 5-10 providers
• They route your data through their servers 🚨
• Crazy expensive ($100+/month)

4/ So I built CloudSync Ultra:
✅ 42+ providers (4x more than competitors)
✅ Everything processes locally
✅ Native Mac app (not Electron)
✅ Fair pricing ($9.99/mo)

5/ Your data never touches our servers.

This isn't marketing speak - there literally is no backend. Your Mac does all the work.

6/ Would love your support on Product Hunt today!

P.S. Free tier available if you just want to try it out 🎁
