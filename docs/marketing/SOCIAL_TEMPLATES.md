### Launch Announcement Thread

```
1/ 🚀 Just launched CloudSync Ultra!

One Mac app that syncs 42+ cloud storage providers with complete privacy.

No more juggling between apps. No more trusting your data to middlemen.

cloudsyncapp.com

Here's what makes it special... 🧵

2/ The problem: I had files everywhere
• Work docs in Google Drive
• Photos in Dropbox
• Backups in Backblaze B2
• Code in GitHub

Managing it all was a nightmare. And existing sync apps? They either supported 5 providers or cost $100/month.

3/ So I built CloudSync Ultra:
✅ 42+ providers (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, OneDrive, Proton Drive...)
✅ Everything processes locally on your Mac
✅ Your data NEVER touches our servers
✅ Native SwiftUI app (not Electron junk)
✅ Just $9.99/month

4/ Use cases our beta testers love:
📸 Photographers: Backup RAW files from Dropbox to B2
💼 Agencies: Sync client Dropbox to company S3
🔒 Privacy folks: Move files from Big Tech to Proton Drive
💻 Developers: Archive GitHub repos to cold storage

5/ The privacy promise:
There's literally no backend. Your Mac does all the work. Credentials are stored in macOS Keychain.

We couldn't see your files if we wanted to. That's the point.

6/ Free tier available:
• 2 cloud connections
• Manual sync
• Perfect for trying it out

Pro unlocks everything:
• Unlimited connections
• Scheduled sync
• Encryption
• Priority support

7/ Built by a solo founder who was tired of:
- Subscription fatigue
- Privacy violations
- Limited provider support
- Electron apps

Your clouds. Your control.

Your sync app shouldn't see your files.

```

**Comparison**
```
Them: 10 providers, $99/month, routes through their servers

The journey of building this as a solo founder has reinforced my belief: the best software solves real problems without compromising user privacy or forcing artificial limitations.

Title: Just launched my Mac app that syncs 42+ cloud storage providers with complete privacy

Hey r/macapps!

After getting frustrated juggling between 10+ different cloud storage accounts, I built CloudSync Ultra - a native SwiftUI app that can sync between any of 42+ cloud providers.

What makes it different:
- No cloud backend (everything processes locally)
- Supports way more providers than alternatives (42+ vs their 10-20)
- Actually native Mac app, not Electron
- Fair pricing ($9.99/mo vs $99/mo for less features)

Some cool use cases:
- Backup Google Photos to Backblaze B2 (way cheaper)
- Sync client Dropbox folders to your company S3
- Mirror OneDrive to your Synology NAS
- Move files from Big Tech to privacy-focused clouds

There's a free tier with 2 connections if you want to try it out.

Happy to answer any questions about the tech stack, privacy architecture, or anything else!

Title: Built a tool to sync between 42+ cloud storage providers - perfect for distributed backups

Fellow data hoarders,

If you're like me and have data scattered across multiple cloud providers for redundancy, I built something that might help.

CloudSync Ultra can sync between 42+ different cloud storage providers:
- All the usual suspects (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
- Cheap storage (B2, Wasabi, S3 Glacier)
- Privacy-focused (Proton Drive, MEGA, Tresorit)
- Self-hosted (Nextcloud, WebDAV, SFTP)

Key features for our community:
- Scheduled automated backups
- Bandwidth throttling (don't anger the ISP)
- Chunk optimization for large files
- Detailed transfer logs
- No file size limits (tested with 100GB files)

Everything processes locally on your machine - there's no cloud backend that your files pass through.

Currently Mac-only but planning Linux support based on demand.

Thoughts? What's your current multi-cloud backup setup?
