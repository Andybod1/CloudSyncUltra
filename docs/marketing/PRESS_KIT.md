## Press Release

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

### CloudSync Ultra Launches: The First Mac App to Sync 42+ Cloud Storage Providers with Complete Privacy

**San Francisco, CA - February XX, 2026** — CloudSync Ultra, a revolutionary new macOS application, today announced its official launch on the Mac App Store. The app enables users to seamlessly manage and sync files across more than 42 cloud storage providers—from Google Drive and Dropbox to AWS S3 and Proton Drive—all from a single, beautifully designed native Mac interface.

In an era where individuals and businesses routinely juggle multiple cloud storage accounts, CloudSync Ultra solves a critical problem: the complexity and security risks of managing diverse cloud services. Unlike existing solutions that require users to upload data to intermediary servers, CloudSync Ultra processes everything locally on the user's Mac, ensuring complete privacy and data sovereignty.

"I built CloudSync Ultra because I was frustrated with having to choose between functionality and privacy," said [Founder Name], creator of CloudSync Ultra. "Existing sync tools either support only a handful of providers or require you to trust them with your data. CloudSync Ultra supports every major cloud provider while ensuring your files never touch our servers."

**Key features of CloudSync Ultra include:**

- Support for 42+ cloud storage providers, more than any competitor
- Complete privacy with local-only processing and no cloud backend
- Professional features including scheduled sync, encryption, and bandwidth control
- Native macOS app built with SwiftUI for optimal performance
- Pricing that's 90% lower than comparable alternatives

The app launches with a free tier that allows users to connect two cloud accounts with manual sync capabilities. The Pro tier, priced at $9.99 per month, unlocks unlimited connections and advanced features. A Team tier at $19.99 per user per month adds collaborative features and audit logs.

Early beta testers have praised the app's simplicity and comprehensive provider support. "CloudSync Ultra saved our agency hours every week managing client files across different platforms," said Sarah Chen, Design Director at [Agency Name]. "The fact that it's also the most private option available made it an easy choice."

CloudSync Ultra is available immediately on the Mac App Store and directly from www.cloudsyncapp.com. A 30-day free trial of Pro features is available with no credit card required.

**About CloudSync Ultra**
